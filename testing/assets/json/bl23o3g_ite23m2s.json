Some are fascinating works of art, and no other man made artefacts document the evolution of social relations, economic trends, technological innovations, philosophical views on man and nature, politics and culture more eloquently than architecture and urbanism. Cities and buildings impact our everyday lives. They define where and how we live, how far we have to travel to reach our working places, our daily rhythms of our movements, the things we see when we are on our way. Their impact on is self-evident â€“ urban planners gave us our sewage systems, architects decent public housing andcare buildings. This master track provides students a rich and varied introduction in the history and theory of architecture and urban planning. Sincecare architecture requires a thorough understanding of the history and theory of architecture, and the world ofy cities can only be analyzed against the background of urbanism, the Expertise Centre Architecture, Urbanism and is embedded in a classical approach of architectural and urban history and theory. It allows students to specialize in classical history and theory, the impacts of architecture and urbanism, or a mixture."
