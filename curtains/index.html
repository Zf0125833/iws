        <p>Hi! My name is John Stripe, and I'm a designer and developer.</p>
        <p>I combine creative vision with technical skills to craft functional and aesthetically pleasing solutions. My
          experience allows me to work at the intersection of design and development, bringing ideas to life from
          concept
          to finished product.
        </p>
        <p>My main areas of focus include:</p>
        <p>User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design: I create intuitive and enjoyable digital products,
          paying
          close attention to every detail of the interaction.</p>
        <p>Web Development: I specialize in building responsive and high-performance websites and applications using
          modern technologies.</p>
        <p>I love seeing ideas transform into reality, and I'm always eager for new challenges that allow me to learn
          and
          grow.</p>
